Situation:
Practice CSS Skills by creating a small part of a weather website.
The website displays information to users on sun protection for 
those hot summer days at the beach. 


Task:
The HTML code is already on the webpage. 
1. It has a h2 element with title, "UV Protection Chart".
2. A paragraph element with text,
   "Extreme: Wear Sunscreen, Sunglasses, a hat and look for shade."
3. A second paragraph element with text,
   "Medium: Wear Sunscreen, Sunglasses, and a hat."
4. A last paragraph element with text,
   "Low: Wear Sunscreen and Sunglasses."
   Your task is to code the CSS part and beautify it.  


Action:
1. Start by adding the 'style' attribute along with the 
   '=' and '""' signs to h2 attribute.
2. It's best if the heading is more noticable,
   so set the 'font-family' to 'Impact'.
3. Set the text color to orange.
4. Add the style attribute to all the other text elements.
5. Set the background color of the first paragraph to red.
6. Set the background color of the second paragraph to orange.
7. Set the background color of the third paragraph to gold.
