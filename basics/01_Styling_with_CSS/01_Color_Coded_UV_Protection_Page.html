<!-- 
Situation:
Practice CSS Skills by creating a small part of a weather website.
The website displays information to users on sun protection for 
those hot summer days at the beach. 


Task:
The HTML code is already on the webpage. 
1. It has a h2 element with title, "UV Protection Chart".
2. A paragraph element with text,
   "Extreme: Wear Sunscreen, Sunglasses, a hat and look for shade."
3. A second paragraph element with text,
   "Medium: Wear Sunscreen, Sunglasses, and a hat."
4. A last paragraph element with text,
   "Low: Wear Sunscreen and Sunglasses."
   Your task is to code the CSS part and beautify it.
