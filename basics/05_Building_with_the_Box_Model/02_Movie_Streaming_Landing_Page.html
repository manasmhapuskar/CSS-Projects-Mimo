<!-- 
Situation:
In this project, we'll build a landing page for a streaming service. 

 
Task:
This is how the finished project looks, with the paddings, margins,
width and height all set. 
Part I
Add the homeflix image in the index page.

Part II
Time to add some headings and paragraphs.

Part III
Basic structure of the website is ready.
It's time to add some style with CSS.

Part IV
We're almost there. All we have to do now is style the text 
by adding paddings and margins.
