Situation:
Let's use paddings to illustrate how email apps can change 
how they display their emails. 

 
Task:
We'll switch between compact, default and comfortable view
settings by setting different padding values for each. 


Action:
HTML ->
*. Code the doctype, html and body elements.
1. Code the head and link elements.
2. Add an h3 heading titled, "Inbox".
3. Add four paragraphs differently displaying,
   "Multivitamins with multiple savings"
   "Mom - Why do you never call or write?"
   "Zbay - Your package is on it's way!"
   "An Update from Mimo" 

CSS ->
1. The first step is adding the p selector.
2. Set the border to solid 1px gray.
3. To make emails stand out,
   set background color to lightSteelBlue.
4. To make it more like an email app with messages displaying
   directly below each other, set margin to 0.
5. Before adding the individual paddings, add the padding property.
6. To show the compact view, ensure there's no space 
   at the top or bottom of emails by setting padding to 0 10px 0 10px.
7. To show the default view add more space to the top and bottom by
   setting the padding to 10px 20px 10px 20px.
8. For the comfortable view, which has lot of space, 
   add more padding on each side with 30px 25px 15px 25px.
