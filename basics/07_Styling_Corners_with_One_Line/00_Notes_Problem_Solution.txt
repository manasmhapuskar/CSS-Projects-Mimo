CSS Code:
body {
    text-align: center;
}

h2 {
    margin: 40px 0 0 0;
}

img {
    border-radius: 10px;
}

p {
    margin: 0;
}

button {
    background-color: purple;
    border-radius: 30px;
    color: white;
    font-size: 18px;
    margin: 0;
} 


Task:
Correct the newsletter with the help of your knowledge with margins. 


Action:
1. As first step, give the heading some space by setting
   'margin' to 40px 30px 30px 30px.
2. To add more space at the top of paragraphs, 
   set 'margin' to 30px 0 0 0 as well.
3. We can see that adding space to the sides would help,
   so adjust the side margins by adding 30px 0 30px
4. To add more space at the top of the button,
   set 'margin' to 30px 0 0 0.
