Situation:
Apply the knowledge about paddings and margins by styling 
the overview page of a photography website.
The basic structure of website is ready that contains
a heading and images. 

 
Task:
The job is to drastically improve the website by adding CSS. 


Action:
HTML ->
*. Code the doctype, html & body elements.
1. Add the heading h2 titled, "Photos contributed by our users"
2. Add six images, their links are,
   "https://mimo.app/r/tree.png"
   "https://mimo.app/r/trees.png"
   "https://mimo.app/r/starrynight.png"
   "https://mimo.app/r/lighthouse.png"
   "https://mimo.app/r/pathway.png"
   "https://mimo.app/r/ridge.png"
3. Arrange the images in a 2*3 matrix. 
4. Add the head tags and link element.

CSS ->
1. First let's make sure the images are small enough to fit
   on the screen.
   Create a rule for img elements with 'height' set to 100px.
2. Set the 'width' to 100px.
3. Set a 10px margin for all images.
4. Add a 'border' property and set the values to 'solid olive'.
5. Set the 'padding' to 5px.
6. Now, let's make the h2 element look nicer too.
   Start by creating a rule for h2 and 
   setting the 'background-color' to lightGrey.
7. Set the 'margin' property to 10px.
8. Set 'padding-top' to 30px.
9. Set 'padding-bottom' to 10px.
10. The heading is wider than both the images.
    If we add the width of the images, margins and paddings, it sums upto 250px.
    Match up the sizes by setting width to 250px for the heading.
11. The heading is not completely aligned with the images because it has no border.
    Add a border property and set it to 'solid olive'.
12. Finally, center the text.
    Set the 'text-align' property to center.

Situation:
In this project, we'll build a landing page for a streaming service. 

 
Task:
This is how the finished project looks, with the paddings, margins,
width and height all set. 
Part I
Add the homeflix image in the index page.

Part II
Time to add some headings and paragraphs.

Part III
Basic structure of the website is ready.
It's time to add some style with CSS.

Part IV
We're almost there. All we have to do now is style the text 
by adding paddings and margins.

 
Action:
HTML ->
Part I
*. Code the doctype, html and body elements.
1. Now code the head element and link element inside it.
2. Create an img element with src as "https://getmimo.com/r/homeflix.png"

Part II
1. Code the h1 element titled, "See what's next".
2. Code the h3 element titled, "Watch anywhere, but mostly from home".
3. Create a link to signup page that displays "Try 30 days Free"
   with src as "https://mimo.app/r/homeflix.html".
4. Create a paragraph that displays "Watch TV shows and movies anytime, anywhere". 


CSS ->
Part I
1. Create a rule for body tags and add background color as black.
2. The text became invisible. To make it visible again,
   add color as white in body rule.
3. Set the text-align property to center to make everything on the
   webpage horizontally centered.
4. Add 'font-family' as 'Verdana, sans-serif' to change the font.
5. We'll add some breathing room.
   At the top of the style sheet, add a rule for all img elements,
   and set 'margin' to 40px.
6. Set the height to 40px and width to 150px.

Part II
1. Let's make the link color match the logo. 
   Add a rule for all the link elements and set color to red.
2. Let's add some space between the logo and the heading.
   Add a rule for all h1 elements and set 'margin-top' to 30px.
3. Add a rule for all h3 elements and set 'margin' to 20px.
4. Now let's make the paragraph stand out.
   First, add a rule for all p elements and set background color to dimGray.
5. Let's push the paragraph out of the way so that the heading and link
   are the main focus of the page. Set the 'margin-top' to 80px.
6. Now, we'll give the paragraph some breathing room.
   Set margin left to 30px.
7. Set margin right to 30px.
8. And finally let's add some space inside the paragraph.
   Set padding to 20px.

Situation:
In this project, we'll practice setting individual margins,
paddings and border radiuses in one line.

We'll do that by polishing up the design of a small business website.
Here's a peek at the finished product. 

We've already added the webpage structure and a few styles inside 
style.css.

HTML ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Fast Furniture</h2>
        <div>
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/minimalist-living-room.png" alt = "" />
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/modern-living-room.png" alt = "" />
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/cozy-living-room.png" alt = "" />
        </div>
        
        <button>Open Catalogue</button>
        <p>
            All furniture made for fast shipping and easy assembly!
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS ->
body {
    text-align: center;
}

h2 {
    background-color: aliceBlue;
}

img {
    width: 100px;
    height: 60px;
    background-color: lightBlue;
}

button {
    background-color: darkCyan;
    color: white;
}

p {
    background-coloe: aliceBlue;
