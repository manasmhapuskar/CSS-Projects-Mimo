Situation:
Let's practice our knowledge of inheritance by styling
a simple comments section. 


Plan:
We already have the name of the poster, their comment, and some styling. 
We'll add replies to this comment and organize them a little 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h4>Longface</h4>
        <p>
            ugh, whoever decided to invite honeydew 
            to the fruitful party is unfollowed forever
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
h4 {
    margin: 5px 0 5px 0;
}

p {
    margin: 0 0 15px 0;
} 


Action:
1. First add the tags so the div element is a parent to two child elements.
   Add an h4 heading titled "Danette" and 
   a paragraph with the text, "Not this again..."
2. Add two more child elements inside the div element.
   First is an h4 heading titled, "Mr. Jellyspread" and
   a paragraph with the text, "Honey-DO tell me more about that party".
3. To make the elements inside the div element look like replies,
   create a div selector and set the margin to 40px.
4. To change the font color of the replies,
   set the div element's color to gray.
5. Code the property that the child elements of div
   can inherit from their parent.
   Here's its font size which should be set to 12px.

Situation:
Let's practice our skills on inheritance by styling 
notifications on a phone lock screen. 

 
Plan:
We'll start with a couple of notifications and
some basic styling to the lockscreen. 


Avalability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>21:00</h1>
        <h5>25 Dec - Cloudy</h5>
        <p>
            Instagram - 12m
        </p>
        <p>
            Messenger - 29m
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: bisque;
}

p {
    border: solid 1px bisque;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 10px;
} 


Action:
1. First, make a div element the parent of the two paragraph,
   elements by adding the tags.
2. Next, add anpther p element so that div has three child elements.
   Set the text to "Gmail - 30m". 
3. Make the notifications stand out by setting the div element's
   background-color to whiteSmoke.
4. Make the border radius of the div element to 10px.
5. Change the notification's font size by 
   setting their parent element's font-size to 14px.
6. Use inheritance to set align notification's text to left.
