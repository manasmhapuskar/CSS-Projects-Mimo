<!-- 
Situation:
Let's practice our knowledge of inheritance by styling
a simple comments section. 


Plan:
We already have the name of the poster, their comment, and some styling. 
We'll add replies to this comment and organize them a little 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h4>Longface</h4>
        <p>
            ugh, whoever decided to invite honeydew 
            to the fruitful party is unfollowed forever
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
h4 {
    margin: 5px 0 5px 0;
}

p {
    margin: 0 0 15px 0;
}
