Situation:
Let's see how we can use multiple classes to 
style some blog posts 


Plan:
We already have the HTML content. We'll add classes to elements
and then define CSS rules to style them.


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>SpaceX Dragon Launch</h3>
            <p>
                The SpaceX crew successfully launched ...
            </p>
            <button>Read More</button>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Grammy Awards 2021</h3>
            <p>
                The 2021 grammy awards were hosted by ...
            </p>
            <button>Read More</button>
        </div>
    </body>
</html> 


Action:
1. Add class 'blogPost' for the first and second div elements.
2. Add the class called 'featuredPost' to the first div element.
3. Add a class called 'blogTitle' to the first h3 element.
4. Add another class called 'featuredTitle' to the first h3 element.
5. Set background color to snow.
6. Next, add a 10px padding.
7. As a last step for the div elements,
   add a 10px margin.
8. Style the featuredPost class by adding a border of
   3px solid gold.
9. Create a selector for the 'blogTitle' class and
   set 'font-family' to 'Arial' and font-size to 25px.
10.Create a selector for the 'featuredTitle' class and
   the set the color to 'goldenRod'.

Situation:
Time to practice our skills on combining multiple classes by
designing an email app interface 


Plan:
We'll start with HTML content already added and
an empty CSS file 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h2>MailBox</h2>
        <p>
            From Mimo - Welcome to Mimo
        </p>
        <p>
            From Amazon - Your toaster has skipped
        </p>
        <p>
            From Twitter - @spongebob mentioned you
        </p>
        <p>
            From Trillionaire - Get your million dollar check
        </p>
    </body>
</html>


Action:
1. Add the class name 'mail' to all the p elements.
2. Add another class named 'unread' to the first p and
   spam to the last p element.
3. Make the second email appear as unread by adding
   unread to the second p element.
4. Create a selector for the mail class with an empty rule.
5. Style the mail class by setting border to 2px solid gray,
   margin to 5px, and padding to 5px.
6. Style the 'unread' class by setting background color to purple,
   color to white and font-weight to bold.
7. Add the '.spam' rule and set color to coral.
8. Set the font to italic.

Situation:
Let's practice our skills on using multiple class by
coding a calendar that displays the remaining days in a week. 


Plan:
We'll start of with a heading and a paragraph 
for each day of the week. 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Week Calendar</h2>
        <p>Monday</p>
        <p>Tuesday</p>
        <p>Wednesday</p>
        <p>Thursday</p>
        <p>Friday</p>
        <p>Saturday</p>
        <p>Sunday</p>
    </body>
</html>


Action:
1. Add a class name of 'day' to the first p element.
   To help you, we've added the same class to the
   other paragraph elements as well.
2. In third p opening tag, add the class name 'today' and
   'weekend' to the p elements with Sunday and Saturday as their text.
3. Add the class name 'past' to the first two p elements.
4. Create a rule for elements of class 'day' and
   set background color to bisque, margin to 5px,
   padding to 10px, and text align to center.
5. Create a 'weekend' class selector and style it by setting
   background color to plum, and font style to italic.
6. Create a rule for elements of class '.today' and
   set font weight to bold and border of 2px solid gray.
7. Create a rule for elements of '.past' and 
   set color to gray, and background color to lightGray.
