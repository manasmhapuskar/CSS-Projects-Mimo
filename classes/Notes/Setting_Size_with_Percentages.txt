Situation:
Let's learn how to create progress bars with the help of percentages. 


Plan:
We already have the HTML, along with some style rules 
for div and p elements. 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Progress Bars</h1>
        <div>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p></p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
div {
    border: solid 2px black;
    margin: 5px;
}

p {
    height: 50px;
    margin: 0;
} 


Action:
1. Start the setting the class attribute for the first p element
   to the value "full".
2. Add the class name half to the second p element.
3. Last, add the class name low to the last p element.
4. Create an empty rule for the .full class.
5. Set the width to 100%.
6. Set background color to green (hex code).
7. Add two more rules. The first, for a class called .half,
   and the second for a class called .low.
8. For elements of class .half, set width to 50% and
   background-color to orange (hex code).
9. For the elements of class .low, set width to 10% and
   background color to red (hex code).

Situation:
Let's advance our skills by working on an app that
displays the amount of time apps are used on a phone.


Plan:
We'll start off with the HTML code and
some styles for HTML elements. 


Availability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">

    <body>
        <h2>Screen Time</h2>
        <div>
            <button>Gaming<br>40%</button>
            <button>Movies<br>35%</button>
            <button>Music<br>25%</button>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
div {
    border: ridge 2px gray;
    font-size: 0;
} 


Action:
1. Set the first button's class attribute to the value 'gaming'.
2. Add class 'movies' to the second button element.
3. Set the third button's class attibute to 'music'.
4. Create an empty rule for the .gaming class selector.
5. Style the .gaming class by setting width to 40% and
   background color to skyblue (hex code).
6. Style the .movies class by setting width to 35% and
   background color to wheat (hex code).
7. Style the .music class by setting width to 25% and
