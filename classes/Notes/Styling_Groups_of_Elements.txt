Situation:
Let's use our knowledge of div elements to
style a web music player

 
Task:
To prototype how the web page will look,
we added images for the buttons, along with some styles.
All that's left is styling the icons. 

 
Available:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Currently playing: </p>
        <h5>The Peanutbutterers - Where's My Jelly At</h5>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/player-button-previous.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/player-button-play.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/player-button-previous.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/player-button-next.png" alt = "" title = "">
    </body>    
</html> 

CSS Code ->
body {
    background-color: azure;
}

img {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
}


Action:
1. Next, add an empty rule for the div selector.
2. Inside the div rule, center the group of icons we just created.
3. Highlight the group of icons by setting background color to lightCyan.
4. Set padding to 15px for the div element.

Situation:
To practice styling groups of elements some more,
let's style a chatbox containing a message from a bot. 

 
Task:
We already have some headings, paragraphs, and some basic styles.
We'll make the text in the message appear in a message bubble. 

 
Available:
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>You have 1 unread message(s): </h3>
        <h5>Arnold</h5>
        <p>
            beep beep beep Hello there!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am A21016, but friends call me Arnold. I'm here to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can I help you today?
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    background-color: aliceBlue;
}

h5 {
    color: gray;
    margin: 0 0 0 30px;
} 


Action:
1. Let's begin by grouping the paragraph element inside a div element.
2. Next, start styling the group of paragraphs
   by adding the div selector and the braces.
3. Inside the div rule, set border radius to 10px.
4. Make the message in the chatbox stand out by
   setting background color to lightBlue.
5. Improve the layout of the chatbox by
   setting margin to 20px and padding to 10px.
