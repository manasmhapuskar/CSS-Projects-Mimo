Situation:
Let's use our knowledge of classes to build a user dashboard. 


Plan:
We'll start with three div elements that 
contain content but haven't been styled.


Avalability:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            Profile
            Messages
            Settings
            Help
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src = "https://bit.ly/2WkDp5F" alt = "" title = "">
            <h4>Joe Dramatic</h4>
            <h5>5 million followers</h5>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
img {
    width: 100px;
} 


Action:
1. Set the first div element's class to 'title'.
2. Set the second div element's class to 'navigation'.
3. Set the third div element's class to 'content'. 
4. Add a rule that sets background color to coral
   for elements of the title class.
5. Create a rule that styles elements of the navigation class
   with background color set to lightCoral and color set to white.
6. Style elements of the content class with background color set to
   linen and text-align set to center.
7. Let's apply a style to all div elements by creating a rule
   that sets margin bottom to 10px.
8. To give tidy up the layout, use the div selector to set
   border radius to 5px and padding to 12px for all div elements.
