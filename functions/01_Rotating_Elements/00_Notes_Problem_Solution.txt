Situation:
There are many types of apps for musicians.
One of the most common being guitar tuner apps. 


Task:
With the help of a CSS function, we'll prototype the interface of a
brand new guitar tuning app by rotating some images. 


Given:
HTML Code
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css" />
        <body>
            <h3>Decibel tuner</h3>
            <p>D ------- D# ------- E ------- F ------- F#</p>
            <p>|_______|___ 82.4Hz ___|_______|</p>
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/r/needle.png" alt = "" />
        </body>
    </head>
</html>

CSS Code
body {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: lightBlue;
}

h3 {
    font-family: Courier New;
}


Action:
1. We'll start by rotating the app heading. 
   For that we'll need the 'transform' property.
2. Add the 'rotate()' CSS function.
3. To give the heading a fresh vibe set 'rotate()' to '-8deg'.
4. Finish the styling by setting 'font-style' to 'italic'
5. To prepare the image for rotating, start by adding the img selector.
6. To prevent the image corners from overlapping the paragraphs when rotating,
   set the radius to 150px around all the corners.
7. Add the property and function necessary to rotate this image,
   the 'transform' property.
8. Let's test it!
   Add '-30deg' to show that the guitar string is tuned lower in frequency than it should be.
9. Now add 45deg to show that the guitar string is higher in frequency than it should be.
