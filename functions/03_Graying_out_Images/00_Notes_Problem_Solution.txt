Situation:
A coding platform is preparing a special website for Halloween. 
They've asked us to use CSS to make it spookier for the occasion 

 
Task:
We have headings, paragraphs, images and empty links.
All that's left is to finish working on the CSS.

 
Given:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Programming Mysteries</h2>
        <a href = "">Find out what line breaks really do to your HTML</a>
        <br>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/ghost-small.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <br>
        <a href = "">Learn what bug Whiskers found in his code</a>
        <br>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/whispurr.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <h2>Submit your own scary story</h2>
        <p>
            Have a scary story of your own?
            Email us for a chance to get featured in next month's issue!
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Monospace;
}


Action:
1. Start by adding an h2 selector and filter: blur(1px)
   inside of it.
2. Next, add an image selector.
3. Set the filter property to grayscale(100%) for all images.
4. Add a bit more of space around the images by setting the margins.
5. Style the links using an a selector by setting color to black
   and background color to lightGray.
6. Add the filter property and set opacity to 60%.

Situation:
An E-commerce company is about to launch and they've asked
for your help in designing a webpage for out of stock products. 

 
Task:
Most of their webpage is already coded.
All we have to do is add some CSS to show the items are out of stock. 

 
Given:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">

    <body>
        <h1>Zbay</h1>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/phone.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <h3>Yphone Model X</h3>
        <div>
            <a href = "">S</a>
            <a href = "">XL</a>
            <a href = "">Black</a>
            <a href = "">White</a>
        </div>
        <button>Add to basket</button>
    </body>
</html> 

CSS Code ->
button {
    margin-top: 30px;
    background-color: gold;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 20px;
}

2. Add border and set it to solid 1px black.

   set filter to grayscale(80%).
4. Style the links using an a selector and
   setting the background color to lightGray.
5. Set the padding to 10px.
6. Set the border to solid 1px black.
7. To make the links appear inactive as well,
   set 'filter' to opacity(50%).
