<!--
Situation:
A coding platform is preparing a special website for Halloween.
They've asked us to use CSS to make it spookier for the occasion


Task:
We have headings, paragraphs, images and empty links.
All that's left is to finish working on the CSS.


Given:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Programming Mysteries</h2>
        <a href = "">Find out what line breaks really do to your HTML</a>
        <br>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/ghost-small.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <br>
        <a href = "">Learn what bug Whiskers found in his code</a>
        <br>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/whispurr.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <h2>Submit your own scary story</h2>
        <p>
            Have a scary story of your own?
