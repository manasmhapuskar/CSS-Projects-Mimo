<!-- 
Situation:
Let's practice creating gradients by 
working on a landing page for a new app. 

 
Task:
Part I
We already have the HTML code, which consists of two headings and an image.
We'll focus on styling the first heading and the body. 

Part II
Let's continue working on the landing page for Photogram.
This time we'll focus on styling the image beneath the heading.


Given:
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Photogram</h1>
        <h2>Where Your Photos Belong</h2>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/astro-photographer.png" alt = "" title = "">
    </body>
</html>
-->
