Situation:
A softwre company called Mudcap is prototyping an app for
batch editing photos and they've asked us to create some filters 

 
Task:
We'll start off with the app name, a few images on the webpage and
a blank CSS file. Let's get styling. 

 
Given:
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>Darkroom</h1>
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/bank-lobby.png" alt = "" title = "">
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/loft.png" alt = "" title = "">
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/lakeside.png" alt = "" title = "">
        </div>
    </body>
</html> 


Action:
1. Add a body selector and set background color to slateGray.
2. To turn the font white, set color to white.
3. Set text-align to center.
4. Now, we'll work on the images and try out some filters.
   Start by adding an img selector and setting the margin to 10px 0 20px 0.
5. Set border to solid 2px aliceBlue.
6. Now, let's prototype some filter possibilities.
   As a first step, try to saturate images by reducing it to 75%.
7. Let's add more punch by coding contrast(80%) after saturate().
8. Let's try something different by changing saturate(75%) to grayscale(100%).
9. It seems like a bit more contrast would help.
   Set contrast to 120%.
10. Let's make our images more vivid this time.
    Change filter to saturate(200%) and brightness(110%).

Situation:
Let's refine our filter building skills by styling a
part of a photography website. 


Task:
We'll start with the photograph along with some styling 
and we'll experiment with filters until we get something we like. 


Given:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/sea-of-clouds.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <p><em>White Sea of Clouds</em> | Szabo Viktor | 2018</p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    background-color: beige;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: monospace;
}

img {
    background-color: white;
    border: solid 2px black;
    width: 200px;
    height: 300px;
    padding: 50px;
} 


Action:
1. Let's start by setting the image's brightness to 50%.
2. That doesn't quite work. 
   Let's try increasing the brightness to 80%.
3. Let's add extra functions.
   Set the saturation of the image to its default level.
4. Let's try making the colors a bit less vivid.
   Adjust saturation to 75%.
5. Use the right function to decrease the contrast between
   the lighter and the darker parts of the photograph by 50%.
6. Doesn't really work. 
   Let's increase the contrast to 150% instead.
