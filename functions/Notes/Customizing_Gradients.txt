Situation:
Let's practice creating gradients by 
working on a landing page for a new app. 

 
Task:
Part I
We already have the HTML code, which consists of two headings and an image.
We'll focus on styling the first heading and the body. 

Part II
Let's continue working on the landing page for Photogram.
This time we'll focus on styling the image beneath the heading.


Given:
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Photogram</h1>
        <h2>Where Your Photos Belong</h2>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/astro-photographer.png" alt = "" title = "">
    </body>
</html> 


Action:
Part I
1. Add a body selector and set background color to linen and 
   align text to center.
2. Next, add an h1 selector and set color to white and
   padding to 75px 0 75px 0.
3. Now, lets add the gradient. Start with background.
4. Then, set background to the linear-gradient function.
5. To create the gradient, add pink, purple and darkBlue colors.
6. To rotate the gradient, add 45deg followed by a comma.
7. To add a bit of contrast, create a border by coding,
   solid 10px white.
8. Inside the h1 rule, set border-radius to 50px.

Part II
1. Start off by adding an img selector and 
   coding width to 150px.
2. Inside the img rule, add padding as 10px.
3. Now let's add the gradient. Start by coding background.
4. Then add the linear gradient function.
5. To create the gradient, add pink, purple, darkBlue colors.
6. To rotate the gradient in the opposite direction of the heading gradient,
   add 225deg (360-45) followed by the comma.
7. Finally, add a border radius of 20px.

Situation:
Let's style a travel website to practice our skills 
in creating background gradients.

 
Plan:
We'll start with a header, an image and a description.
We'll just spice these up with some gradients fitting for the seaside. 


Available:
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>Vacation Marketplace</h3>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/clear-water-beach.png" alt = "" title = "">
        <p>
            <em>Book with us to exchange old memories for new ones!</em>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    text-align: center;
}

h3 {
    height: 40px;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
}

img {
    height: 300px;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
} 


Action:
1. Code the background property and set it to empty
   linear gradient function for the h3 selector.
2. Add colors to the gradient so it starts with aliceBlue
   and transitions to white.
3. Make a gradient for the img selector that starts with
   bisque, transitions to white, and ends with bisque.
4. Change the gradient for the img element so that it
   transitions from left to right.
5. Make a 45deg diagonal gradient for the body element 
   that starts with lightBlue, transitions to snow and ends with white.
