Problem:
Let's practice the 'float' property by designing a question card,
a popular way to display a question and who's asking it.


Available:
We'll start with all of the HTML already added along with a bit
of style for the div element which makes up the card
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/babaganoosh.png" alt = "">

                There has been a serious argument between the residents
                of Chase Street and Terrence Avenue.

            <h6>10k views</h6>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
div {
    width: 300px;
    border: 1px solid lightGray;
    padding: 10px;
}


Solution:
1. Create an empty rule for img element.
2. Set the width of image to 70px.
3. To make image stick to the left side, code float to left.
4. Add space around the image by setting margin to 5px.
5. Make the image round by setting border-radius to 50%.
6. Create an empty rule for h2 element.
7. Make sure the h2 element starts on a new line below the image
   by coding clear to left.

Problem:
Let's use the float property to style an app profile page.
We'll use the property to place images in different places on the page.


Available:
We'll start off with images and headings added and their classes already set.
We also styled the div element that contains the profile.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <img class = "logo" src = "https://mimo.app/i/code-flag-2.png" alt = "">
        <h2>Coders Group</h2>
        
        <div>
            <img class = "profile" src = "https://mimo.app/i/dark-icon.png" alt = "">

        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
div {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: lavender;
    padding: 15px;
    margin: 5px;
}

img {
    width: 100px;
}


Solution:
1. Create an empty rule for the .logo class.
2. Make the logo stay on the left side by coding 'float' to 'left'.
3. To make the div element not wrap around the image,
   code 'clear' to 'left'.
4. Create an empty rule for elements of class .profile.
5. Make the profile picture stay on the right side of the text
   by coding 'float' to 'right'.
6. Create an empty rule for h5 element.
7. Make the h5 element not wrap around the profile picture
   by setting 'clear' to 'right'.

Problem:
Let's use the 'float' property to design the page of 
a brand new online bank.
We'll use images to differentiate between translations.


Available:
We'll start off with the HTML coded, along with a few styles for
images and div elements that represent different transfers.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Recent Transfers</h1>
        
        <div class = "credit">
            <img class = "creditImage" src = "https://mimo.app/i/elijah.png" alt = "">
            <h5>Received $50</h5>
            <p class = "creditText">For Phone Bill</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = "debit">
            <img class = "debitImage" src = "https://mimo.app/i/portrait-cv.png" alt = "">
            <h5>Sent $1500</h5>
            <p class = "debitText">For Macbook</p>
        </div>
    </body>
<html>
    
CSS Code ->
div {
    width: 400px;
    background-color: lavender;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
}

img {
    width: 50px;
}


Solution:
1. Start by creating an empty rule for the credit class
   and set the background color to lime.
2. Create an empty rule for the creditImage class
   and code float to left to move the image to the left side.
3. Create an empty rule for the creditText class.
4. Make the creditText class not wrap around the image 
   by setting clear to left.
5. Create a selector for the debit class and
   set the text align to right and set the background color to lightsalmon.
6. Create an empty rule for the debitImage class and
   float the image to the right.
7. Create an empty rule for the debitText and
   set the clear property to right.
