Problem:
Let's practice relative positioning by changing how we display
three cards meant to show the top three winners in a championship.


Available:
We'll start off with three different strong elements
with classes already set, and an empty style.css file.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <strong class = "first">1st</strong>
        <strong class = "second">2nd</strong>
        <strong class = "third">3rd</strong>
    </body>
</html>


Solution:
1. Create an empty rule for strong elements.
2. Set the 'position' property to 'relative'.
3. Set the padding to 10px.
4. Code an empty rule for element of class '.first'.
5. Set the background color for the elements of
   'first' class to lavender.
6. Create an empty rule for elements of class '.second'.
7. Set the background color for the elements of
   '.second' class to wheat.
8. To move the second strong element downwards,
   code top to 20px.
9. Create a rule for the 'third' class and
   set its background color to pink.
10. To move the third strong element lower than the second,
    set top to 40px.

Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of relative positioning to mimic
how code is positioned inside a code editor.


Available:
We'll start off with the HTML already in place and mock code 
inside the elements. The CSS file also has some basic color styles.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class = "code">
            <p>function run () {</p>
            <p>if (true) {</p>
            <p>return "success";</p>
            <p>} else {</p>
            <p>return "failure";</p>
            <p>} </p>
            <p>} </p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
.code {
    font-family: courier new;
    font-weight: bold;
    width: 500px;
    padding: 5px;
    background-color: #242533;
    color: #bfdaf9;
}


Solution:
1. We'll start by assigning a class name of 'firstIndent'
   to the second, fourth & sixth p element.
2. Next, create an empty rule for the '.firstIndent' class.
3. Code the 'position' property of the '.firstIndent' rule
   and set it to 'relative'.
4. Move the 'firstIndent' class to the right by setting
   left to 30px.
5. Make the 'firstIndent' class stand out by setting
   color to #43cbff.
6. Assign a class name of 'secondIndent' to the
   third and fifth p element.
7. Create an empty rule for elements of class '.secondIndent'.
8. Code the position property of the 'secondIndent' class and
   set it to relative. Then shift its position by setting left to 60px.
9. Make the 'secondTest' class stand out by setting color to #62d76b.

Problem:
Let's practice our relative positioning skills creating
a few basic math formulas.


Available:
We'll start off with the formulas inside p, em and span elements and
the font already set inside style.css
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>x<em>2</em> + y<em>2</em> = 25</p>
        <p>1<span>2</span> + 1<span>3</span> = 5<span>6</span></p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    font-family: courier new;
}


Solution:
1. Create a rule for em elements and set the position to relative.
2. Next move the em elements upward by setting bottom to 5px.
3. Make those numbers smaller by setting font-size of em elements to 10px.
4. Create a rule for span elements and set position to relative.
5. Move the span elements lower by setting top to 20px.
6. Move the span elements that are underneath to the left by 
   setting right to 10px.
7. To show the fraction line, we'll use a property called 'border-top'.
   Set border-top to 2px solid gray.
