Problem:
Let's place a 'sold out' sign over an image of a car
the same way an online auto dealership would.


Available:
We added the image of a car and a styled div element
that displays 'Sold Out' so you can focus on positioning.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Paddy Dealership</h2>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/car.png" alt = "">
        <span class = "price">$25,000</span>
        <div class = "sold">Sold out</div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
img {
    width: 200px;
}

.price {
    color: white;
}

.sold {
    background-color: coral;
    padding: 5px;
    width: 160px;
} 


Solution:
1. To move the image over the 'sold out' sign,
   set the 'position' property of the image to absolute.
2. Place the img element behind all others 
   by setting the z-index to -1.
3. Add position absolute to both the 'sold' and 'price' classes.
4. Move the "sold out" sign by setting top to 150px
   for elements of the 'sold' class.
5. Move the element of the price class down
   by setting the top to 155px.
6. Move the price over the sold out sign 
   by adding z-index to 1 to the price class.
7. Place the price class in a better position
   by setting left to 100px.

Problem:
Let's use absolute positioning to design a book cover.


Available:
We added an image and some styled paragraphs to get you started
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/whiskers.png" alt = "">
        <p class = "title">CATMAN</p>
        <p class = "author">by James Connor</p>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
img {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 1;
    width: 200px;
}

p {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: wheat;
    padding: 5px;
}

.title {
    width: 200px;
}


Solution:
1. Place the element of the title class over the image
   by setting z-index to 2.
2. Center elements of the title class 
   by setting text-align to center.
3. To make the element of the title class fit inside 
   the book cover, set padding 10px 0px 10px 0px.
4. Create an empty rule for the author class.
5. Place the element of the author class over the image
   by setting z-index to 2.
6. Move the element of the author class lower
   by setting top to 220px.
7. Style the author class by setting font style to italic.

Problem:
Let's code a bull's eye target by setting the 'z-index' on elements.

 
Available:
To get you started, we added three styled div elements
that display red, white and black circles on the webpage.
HTML Code ->
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class = "small"></div>
        <div class = "medium"></div>
        <div class = "large"></div>
    </body>
</html>

CSS Code ->
body {
    height: 250px
}

div {
    position: absolute;
    border-radius: 50%;
}

.large {
    background-color: black;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}

.medium {
    background-color: white;
    width: 120px;
    height: 120px;
}

.small {
    background-color: crimson;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
}


Solution:
1. Get started on the base of the target by setting
   the z-index of the large class to 1.
2. To show the circle of the medium class over the base circle,
   set its z-index to 2.
3. Center the circle of the medium class vertically
   by setting top to 50px.
4. Center the medium class horizontally
   by setting left to 50px.
5. To place it over the circle of medium class,
   set the z-index of the small class to 3.
6. Center the circle of the small class vertically
   by setting top to 85px.
7. Center the circle of the small class horizontally
   by setting left to 85px.
